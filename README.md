## Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - Dr. Ana Bell

### Pre Requisite:
* Programming Language and Scripting Language
* Program: A sequence of instructions written so that a computer can perform certain task.
* Script: You can write code to control another software application. They have short development cycle and can be created and deployed rapidly.
* All Scripting Language are programming language. Scripting language do not require compilation and are interpreted instead.
* Python:-
     * General Purpose Language
     * Interpreted
     * High Level
     * Indentation is a requirement
     * Strength is huge collection of Standard Library
     * Lets you work quickly and integrate system more efficiently
     * Performs automatic memory management
     * Supports Operator Overloading
     * Provides both single and multiple inheritance
     * Platform Independent
     * Supports Multithreading
     * Supports Structured and OOP programming paradigm
     * Provides high level dynamic data types and supports dynamic checking: 
            * It stores the value at some memory location 
            * Binds the variable name to that memory container
            * Makes content of container accessible through the Variable name
     * Can be easily integrated with C, C++, Java
