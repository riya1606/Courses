## Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - Dr. Ana Bell
### Other than this course:

* Programming Language and Scripting Language:- 
     * Program: A sequence of instructions written so that a computer can perform certain task.
     * Script: You can write code to control another software application. They have short development cycle and can be created and deployed rapidly.
     * All Scripting Language are programming language. Scripting language do not require compilation and are interpreted instead.
    <br/>
* Python:-
     * General Purpose Language
     * Interpreted
     * High Level
     * Indentation is a requirement
     * Strength is huge collection of Standard Library
     * Lets you work quickly and integrate system more efficiently
     * Performs automatic memory management
     * Supports Operator Overloading
     * Provides both single and multiple inheritance
     * Platform Independent
     * Supports Multithreading
     * Supports Structured and OOP programming paradigm
     * Provides high level dynamic data types and supports dynamic checking: 
            1. It stores the value at some memory location 
            2. Binds the variable name to that memory container
            3. Makes content of container accessible through the Variable name
     * Can be easily integrated with C, C++, Java
     * Since everything in python is an Object, data types are actually classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes

### Lecture 1: What Is Computation?
* Important Course Information
* What is Computation?
* Knowledge are of two types: Declerative (Statement of Fact) and Imperative Knowledge (How To?)
* Basic Machine Architecture
* Alan Turing Computation (You can compute anything using 6 basic primitives.) Modern Programming Language have more convinient set of primitives. Anything computable in one programming language is computable in any other programming language.
* Python Basics: Syntax and Semantics.
* Everything in Python is an object. Python Program manipulate Data Objects.
* Scalar and Non Scalar Objects.(Scalar: Very Basic Objects, Cannot be Divided(int,float,bool,none type) and Non Scalar:Can be Divided(Set, Tuples))
* Type Conversion-Casting: Can convert object of one type to another: Take care of this in python, used in multiple places.
* Operator Precedence - PEMDAS
* Variables: Keep a descriptive name and put some values into it. No need to specify the data type. Python is dynamically typed language.

### Lecture 2: Branching and Iteration
* Strings
* input()- this gives you string so you must cast it. int(input("Enter a Number"))
* Comparison Operator used on Strings (Lexiographical Order), int and float. This evaluates to a Boolean (>,<,>=,<=,==,!=).
* Logical Operators on booleans. (and,or,not)
* Control Flow - Branching:
    * if
    * elif
    * else 
* Indentation
* Control Flow - Iterations:
    * While Loop
    * For Loop --> range(start,stop,step)
    * break statement

### Lecture 3: String Manipulation, Guess and Check, Approximations, Bisection
* String Manipulation
    * len()
    * indexing
    * slicing [start:stop:step]
    * Strings are Immutable. Cannot be modified.
    * for loop in string
* Algorithms
    * Guess and Check
    * Approximations
    * Bisection Search (Within 6 guesses).


### Lecture 4: Decomposition, Abstractions, Functions	
* Good Programming
* Decomposition using Functions
* Abstraction
* Function Characteristic
* Variable Scope
* Function as Argument


### Lecture 5: Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, Cloning	
* Tuples
    * Immutable 
    * Indexing
    * Concatenation
    * Slicing
    * len()
    * Can be used to swap variables conveniently
    * To return multiple data from function as function can return only one object
    * Iteration can be done over tuple
* Lists
    * Mutable 
    * Indexing
    * len()
    * Slicing
    * Change Elements- Lists are Mutable
    * Iterating over a list
    * .append()
    * Concatenate
    * del()
    * pop()
    * remove()
    * sort()
    * sorted()
    * remove()
* Converts List to String and String to List
    * String to List: list(s)--> Every character from S an element in L
    * String to List: s.split()--> To split a string on a character parameters(default:spaces)
    * List to String: L.join()--> To turn a list into characters in a string (''.join(L)="abc" |||| '_'.join(L)="a_b_c")
* Aliasing- Changing one changes the other
* Mutability [:]
* Cloning

### Lecture 6: Recursion, Dictionaries	
* Recursion
    * Algorithmically: Divide and Conquer
    * Semantically: Function calls itself 
    * Each Recursive Call to a function creates its own Scope/Environment
    * Tower of Hanoi
    * Fibonacci Numbers
    * Recursion on Non- Numeric: Palindrome
* Dictionaries
    * Associates key to a value
    * {}
    * Add: dictionary_name['key']=value
    * Test: 'key' in Dictionary 
    * Delete: del(Dictionary_name['key'])
    * dictionary.key()--> gives all keys in no specific order
    * dictionary.value()--> gives all value in no specific order
    * Inefficient Fibonacci can be made efficient using Dictionaries
### Lecture 7: Testing, Debugging, Exceptions, Assertions	
* Aim for High Quality: Analogy with Soup
* Testing
    * Unit Testing
    * Regression Testing
    * Integration Testing
    * Random Testing
    * Black Box Testing
    * Glass Box Testing
* Debugging
* Error Messages
* Exceptions:
    * try
    * except 
    * else
    * finally
    * raise
* Assertions   

### Lecture 8: Object Oriented Programming	
* Object
* OOP and Advantages of OOP
* Creating and Using Classes
* Define classes: data instances and methods or behaviour
* Special Operators

### Lecture 9: Python Classes and Inheritance	
* Write code from two Perspective: Implementing the Class, Using the Class
* Class Definition of an object type and Instance of Class
* Use of Object Oriented Programming
* Getter and Setter
* Information Hiding
* Default Arguments
* Hierarchies
* Class Variables
